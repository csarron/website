I am a research scientist at Apple AIML. My research interests include efficient NLP, mobile computing, and ML systems. I have focused on building efficient and practical NLP systems for both edge devices and the cloud, such as on-device (visual) question answering and faster Transformer models.  

Previously, I was a postdoc in the [UW NLP group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) at the University of Washington. I hold a Ph.D. degree in computer science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/). I was a recipient of the [Catacosinos Fellowship](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/about-us/News/Funding-Doctoral-Research-Catacosinos-Fellowship-Awardees-2021) at Stony Brook University and a [Rising Star in Data Science](https://cdac.uchicago.edu/rising-stars/#rising-stars-profiles) at the University of Chicago.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
